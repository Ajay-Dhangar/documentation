# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## What can JavaScript do?

The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

- Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for the user's name, and store it in a variable called `name` so that we can use it later.
- Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the `name` variable and join up some other bits of text with it, to create the final message shown to the user.
- Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a `click` event in our example above to detect when the button was clicked and then run the code that updates the text and image.

These core features are not much use without the many APIs that come with JavaScript, such as the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) APIs that allow us to manipulate HTML and CSS, the various [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) that allow us to do everything from [making simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for resources on the network and [storing data locally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB), to [drawing 2D graphics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) and [rendering 3D graphics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial).

## What is JavaScript not?

JavaScript is not Java. This seems like an obvious statement, but when Java was first released, the two languages were positioned as being similar, so the name JavaScript was a way of trying to ride the wave of excitement around Java. This has caused confusion ever since!

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript engine takes your JavaScript and translates it into something it can understand and execute. Different engines translate the code at different speeds, and execute the code at different speeds. This means that the performance of your JavaScript could be different depending on what engine it is running in.

JavaScript is not a "static" language. Static languages are typically compiled, while dynamic languages are interpreted. In a compiled language, the code you write is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into something the computer can understand. This translation happens before the code is run, and the resulting program can be run at any time afterwards. In contrast, dynamic languages are interpreted. This means there is no compilation stage, and an interpreter has to execute the program for anything to happen. JavaScript is an interpreted language, but it is dynamically typed. This means that you do not have to specify what kinds of things each variable contains, rather the type of the variable is flexible and could be anything at any time.

JavaScript is not a "server-side" language. This means that it runs in the browser, rather than on a server. This means that the code is run on each user's computer, allowing for things to happen on the page without having to send information back to the server to be processed before returning again. This is a key difference between JavaScript and server-side languages such as PHP and Ruby, which are "interpreted" by a server. The server then sends the results to the user's browser to be processed.

JavaScript is not a "stripped-down" version of Java. JavaScript is a fully-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. Java is a class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is built around the concept of objects. And while many of the concepts are similar, there are quite a few differences. For example, Java is a compiled language, while JavaScript is an interpreted language. This means that in Java, a program must be converted from human-readable code to a special format (called bytecode) before it can be run, whereas JavaScript can be run without this extra step. In Java, variables must be declared with a specific type, and then they can only hold values of that type. In JavaScript, variables can hold values of any type at any time.

## What is JavaScript used for?

- Adding interactive behavior to web pages
- Creating web and mobile apps
- Building web servers and developing server applications
- Game development
- Creating libraries and frameworks
- Data visualization and manipulation
- Machine learning and AI
- Internet of Things (IoT)

## What does JavaScript look like?

JavaScript is a programming language that is typically used in web development. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions. JavaScript was influenced by many languages and was designed to look like Java, but to be easier for non-programmers to work with.


## What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is a standard. JavaScript is a language that conforms to that standard. JavaScript is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript standard.

| ECMAScript | JavaScript |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| ECMAScript is a standard. | JavaScript is a language that conforms to that standard. |
| ECMAScript is new and improved. | JavaScript is old and busted. |
| ECMAScript is more modern. | JavaScript is more legacy. |
| ECMAScript is the future. | JavaScript is the past. |
| ECMAScript is the standard. | JavaScript is the implementation. |
| ECMAScript is the specification. | JavaScript is the implementation. |

## What is the difference between JavaScript and Java?

JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create interactive web pages. Java is a programming language that is used to create applications that run on a computer or server. JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create interactive web pages. Java is a programming language that is used to create applications that run on a computer or server.
